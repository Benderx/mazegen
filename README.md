# mazegen

Java - a simple maze generator I wrote with a UI. 

Its algorithm only follows 2 simple rules:
1. If a unexplored space exists, explore (move to) that space and break down the wall in the way.
2. If no unexplored space exists, go back one space.

Creation of Maze:
Enter: toggle creation of maze and pausing the creation.
+: make the x maze axis larger
-: make the x maze axis smaller
}: make the y maze axis larger
{: make the y maze axis smaller
Left Click: step the program forward one step to see creation

Playing the maze:
You are the red square and your goal is to get to the green square, use the arrow keys.
